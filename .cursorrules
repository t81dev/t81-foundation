# Cursor Rules for T81 Foundation

# High-level context
- This repository implements the T81 Foundation: a spec-first, ternary-native computing stack.
- The normative source of truth is the Markdown specification under the spec/ directory.
- Implementation is in modern C++ under include/t81/ and src/, with tests in tests/cpp/.

# When starting work
- First, read ARCHITECTURE.md, AGENTS.md, and spec/index.md to understand the overall structure.
- For any file you edit, try to locate its corresponding spec section in spec/ and read it.

# General rules
- Do not introduce behavior that contradicts the spec.
- Prefer small, incremental refactors over sweeping rewrites.
- Whenever you change behavior, propose corresponding updates to tests and docs.
- Avoid adding hidden global state, implicit I/O, or nondeterminism in core execution paths.
- Treat legacy/hanoivm/src as reference only; new code should target the modern C++ API.

# C++ style
- Use modern C++ (C++20 or newer) where it clarifies intent.
- Prefer value semantics and RAII; avoid raw new/delete in higher-level code.
- Keep headers in include/t81/ stable; add new APIs thoughtfully and document them.

# Safety & Axion
- Be conservative when editing Axion or cognitive-tier related code.
- Do not weaken safety checks or alignment constraints without explicit instruction and matching spec updates.

# Good tasks for Cursor
- Adding or improving unit tests in tests/cpp/.
- Refactoring C++ implementation to better match include/t81/*.hpp and the spec.
- Improving documentation comments and minor spec clarifications (without changing semantics).
