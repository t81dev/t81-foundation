# t81-foundation

The core specification and architectural baseline for the T81 Ecosystem—a deterministic, ternary-native computing stack built around base-81 arithmetic, the TISC instruction set, the T81 Virtual Machine, the T81Lang programming language, and the Axion optimization and ethical layer.

This repository defines the formal principles, semantics, and structures that all T81 implementations follow.

---

## Overview

**t81-foundation** serves as the canonical reference for:

- **T81 Data Types** — base-81 numeric primitives and composite structures  
- **TISC (Ternary Instruction Set Computer)** — the low-level ternary ISA  
- **T81VM** — deterministic ternary virtual machine runtime  
- **T81Lang** — strongly typed, ternary-native programming language  
- **Axion Kernel** — optimization, safety, and ethical governance layer  
- **Recursive Cognition Tiers** — T243 → T729 → T2187 → T6561 → T19683  

These layers together form a unified post-binary computation architecture.

## Goals

The T81 foundation is designed to ensure:

- deterministic execution across all environments  
- zero undefined behavior in any layer  
- ternary-native arithmetic and logical semantics  
- interpretability and symbolic transparency  
- extensible cognitive computation  
- ethical stability enforced by Axion  

This repository establishes the standards necessary to maintain a coherent ecosystem.

## Status

This repository represents the **foundational specification layer**.  
Executable components (compilers, VM, toolchain) live in separate repos but follow the standards defined here.

## License

Apache 2.0 (recommended for open standards).  
See `LICENSE` for details.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome if they conform to:

- deterministic semantics  
- ternary-native rules  
- safety and ethical invariants  
- established architectural constraints  

Proposals should be submitted via RFC-style pull requests.

## Roadmap (High-Level)

- Data Types v1.0 (formal spec)
- TISC v1.0 instruction set definition
- T81VM execution model specification
- T81Lang grammar and semantics
- Axion kernel ruleset
- Cognitive tier formalism
- Validation suites and compliance tests
