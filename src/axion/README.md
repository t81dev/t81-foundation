# Axion Kernel

This directory contains the source code for the Axion Kernel, the safety and policy enforcement layer of the T81 system. The Axion Kernel is designed to sit between the T81 Virtual Machine and the underlying hardware, intercepting every instruction and ensuring it complies with a predefined set of safety and thermodynamic policies.

## Core Responsibilities

-   **Policy Enforcement:** The kernel's primary role is to enforce rules on the execution of TISC programs. These rules can range from simple instruction counting to complex, state-dependent security policies.

-   **Thermodynamic Accounting:** The Axion Kernel is responsible for tracking the consumption of `T81Entropy`, the "fuel" of the T81 ecosystem. Every significant operation must be paid for with an entropy token, and the kernel ensures that this accounting is accurate.

-   **Instruction Interception:** The VM is designed to call into the Axion Kernel before executing each instruction. The kernel can then inspect the instruction and the current VM state and return a `Verdict` (see `include/t81/axion/verdict.hpp`) that either permits or denies the operation.

-   **System Call & Trap Handling:** The Axion Kernel serves as the trusted intermediary for all system calls and is responsible for handling traps and faults generated by the VM.

## Current Status

The Axion Kernel is currently implemented as a non-functional **stub**. It permits all operations and does not yet enforce any policies. The development of a robust and fully-featured Axion Kernel is a high-priority item on the project roadmap.

## Components

-   `engine.cpp`: The core implementation of the Axion engine, which contains the logic for evaluating instructions against the current policy set.

-   `axion_api.cpp`: Implements the public-facing C API for interacting with the Axion Kernel.
