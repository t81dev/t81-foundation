# TISC Toolchain

This directory contains the source code for the TISC (Ternary Instruction Set Computer) toolchain. These components are responsible for processing the TISC Intermediate Representation (IR) generated by the compiler frontend and converting it into various output formats.

## Components

-   `binary_emitter.cpp`: The **Binary Emitter** is the core of the TISC toolchain. It takes a TISC `IntermediateProgram` (from `include/t81/tisc/ir.hpp`) and serializes it into the canonical TISC binary format. This binary format is a flat sequence of bytes that can be directly executed by the T81 Virtual Machine. The emitter uses a two-pass approach to resolve label addresses into absolute offsets.

-   `pretty_printer.cpp`: The **Pretty Printer** provides a utility for generating a human-readable, textual representation of a TISC `IntermediateProgram`. This is invaluable for debugging the compiler and understanding the output of the IR generator.

-   `encoding.cpp`: This file contains helper functions and data structures related to the encoding of TISC instructions and their operands.

-   `binary_io.cpp`: Provides utilities for reading and writing TISC binary files.

## Workflow

The TISC toolchain is the final stage in the T81Lang compilation process:

1.  `TISC Intermediate Representation` -> **Binary Emitter** -> `TISC Binary File`
2.  `TISC Intermediate Representation` -> **Pretty Printer** -> `Human-Readable Assembly Text`
