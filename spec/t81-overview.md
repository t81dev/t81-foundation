# T81 Overview
Version 0.1 — Draft

This document provides the conceptual and architectural overview of the T81 Ecosystem.  
It defines the purpose, philosophical grounding, and structural layout of the entire computation stack.

---

## 1. Purpose

T81 is a unified, deterministic, ternary-native computational architecture designed to surpass the limitations of binary computation. It introduces:

- Balanced ternary logic  
- Base-81 arithmetic  
- Deterministic execution  
- Cognitive recursion layers  
- A formal ethical supervisor (Axion)

T81 is intended for safe AI, symbolic cognition, scientific computing, and long-horizon reasoning systems.

## 2. Architectural Layers

Cognitive Tiers — T243 → T19683
Axion Kernel — Ethical/Optimization Layer
T81Lang — High-Level Deterministic Language
TISC — Ternary ISA (Base-81)
T81VM — Deterministic Execution Runtime
Hardware — Physical/Hybrid Layer

Each layer must maintain:

- Determinism  
- Zero undefined behavior  
- Ternary-native semantics  
- Axion-compatible invariants  

---

## 3. Determinism Requirements

The T81 system MUST:

- produce identical outputs for identical inputs  
- not rely on nondeterministic randomness  
- enforce reproducibility across environments  
- use canonical representations for all types  
- serialize execution traces for auditing  

---

## 4. File Organization

This folder contains the core normative specifications for:

- Data Types  
- TISC ISA  
- T81VM  
- T81Lang  
- Axion Kernel  
- Cognitive Tiers  

Each doc stands alone and contributes to the cohesive whole.
