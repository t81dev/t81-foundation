# T81 Foundation — Specification Index
Version 0.1 — Draft

This index provides the official entry point into the T81 Foundation specification set.  
Each document defines a normative component of the T81 Ecosystem and is maintained as part of the standards process.

## Core Documents

| Specification | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **[Overview](t81-overview.md)** | Architectural summary and high-level design of the T81 Ecosystem. |
| **[Data Types](t81-data-types.md)** | Base-81 numeric primitives, composite types, and canonicalization rules. |
| **[TISC Specification](tisc-spec.md)** | Low-level ternary instruction set architecture. |
| **[T81 Virtual Machine](t81vm-spec.md)** | Deterministic execution environment for TISC programs. |
| **[T81Lang](t81lang-spec.md)** | High-level deterministic programming language for T81. |
| **[Axion Kernel](axion-kernel.md)** | Optimization, ethics, verification, and recursion-safety supervisor. |
| **[Cognitive Tiers](cognitive-tiers.md)** | Structured recursive cognition layers from T243 to T19683. |

## Document Structure

All specification documents follow the same principles:

- **Deterministic semantics**  
- **Layer isolation**  
- **No undefined behavior**  
- **Axion compatibility**  
- **Reproducibility across all environments**  
- **Strict canonicalization**  

Each document is standalone and cross-referenced from this index.

---

## Versioning

The specification set is developed in phased releases:

- **v0.x** — Draft and exploratory phases  
- **v1.0** — Complete foundation specification  
- **v2.0+** — Cognitive-tier expansions and hardware-level definitions  

All normative changes must enter via the RFC process.
