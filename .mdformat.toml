[tool.mdformat]

Enable the Git Flavored Markdown (GFM) extension for things like

task lists and tables, and the frontmatter extension for YAML headers.

extensions = [
"gfm",
"frontmatter",
]

Exclude directories that might contain generated or third-party Markdown files

but should not be linted. mdformat respects .gitignore, but this is explicit.

exclude = [
"build/",
"legacy/", # Added to exclude the large unformatted 'legacy/hanoivm' directory
]

[tool.mdformat.number]

This explicitly enables the feature that the --number flag activates.

It ensures that ordered lists are numbered correctly (e.g., all 1.).

enable = true
